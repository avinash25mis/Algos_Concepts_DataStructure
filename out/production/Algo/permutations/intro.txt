Npr   =  P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!

10p4
10! / (10-4)!
= 10! / 6!
= 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6! / 6!

a shortcut is  10 × 9 × 8 × 7  ie   stop factorial at 4th  time
-----------------------------
nCr = n! / r! * (n - r)!

5C3
= 5!/ (5 – 3)! 3!
= (5 * 4 * 3)/3!

Here in code the idea is to move a character to each location present and fixing it after that
