- as it run via stack so we keep on submitting the sub tasks to stack but these subtasks gets executed in reverse order

- in case using some incremental counter to pass as parameter in each call
   use ++i/--i rather than i++/i-- (don't work )
- or you may rather increment it before pass it into the parameter

note that still ++i and i+1 cannot be used interchangeably in the argument as there are scenario where you
want rest of the code to be executed with same value of i , in those cases choose i+1

- in recursion all the subtask wait  for other subtask which are called after it  to gets finished

- in some approaches we directly multiply with the return of the function

how to proceed ?
1.factorial
2.fibonacci
